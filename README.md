###   I am changing careers with the hope of making a more meaningful contribution to society by engineering innovative and dynamic software. I am an analytical and forward thinking pragmatist, who excels in a team setting. I pride myself on a strong work ethic. Building on my past experience I enjoy coding sturdy and robust backend software. I have spent my professional life, diagnosing and repairing vehicles while managing small teams and representing various businesses both in a customer and business facing capacity. ###
